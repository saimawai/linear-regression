This project builds a machine learning model that predicts house prices using Linear Regression. The dataset includes various features such as number of rooms, area, location, and other attributes that influence real-estate pricing.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how linear regression can be applied to a real-world regression problem and how data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation are performed.
